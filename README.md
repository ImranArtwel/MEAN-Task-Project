# MEAN TASK PROJECT 



This project allows the user to register an account then login. After login, user a JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN) is randomly generated by the server and stored locally on the user's browser. This token will be used to authenticate the user for actions like adding tasks and viewing tasks.
The front-end application is powered by Angular2 and the back-end by ExpressJS, thus MEAN representing:

  - MongoDB
  - ExpressJS
  - Angular2
  - NodeJS
